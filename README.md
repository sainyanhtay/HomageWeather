# HomageWeather

cliMate | Minimal Weather app

I created the project with the command `npx react-native init homage_weather` by starting from using react-native CLI.

After that, I added redux, redux-saga for the application middleware, Axios for the network call, and react-native router-flux for the navigations.

To run:

1. Install the libraries with `npm install`

2. Run `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`
